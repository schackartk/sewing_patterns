# Sewing Patterns

I created this repository to hold my self-drafted sewing patterns.

*Please note*, I am a scientist and software engineer by training. I am a self-taught sewist, and have learned from the fantastic contributions others have made to the online sewing communities (shoutout to [r/sewing](https://www.reddit.com/r/sewing/) and [r/myog](https://www.reddit.com/r/myog/)), so I created this repo to contribute back to the community.

With that said, my patterns may have mistakes or not follow conventions that I am not aware of. Please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/schackartk/sewing_patterns/issues/new/choose) to suggest a change or fix, or [contribute to a discussion](https://github.com/schackartk/sewing_patterns/discussions/new/choose).
